# Working in this repository

A GKE cluster built with Terraform and deployed from GitHub Actions. The
application it serves is [sky](https://github.com/sindredg/sky), which has its
own guidance. The README holds the architecture, `plan.md` the phases,
`decisions.md` the reasoning. This file holds what none of them can.

## Authority

The cluster is real, public, and costs money. Propose, never apply. 
Open a pull request, stop and let the repo owner review and apply it.

An authorisation to apply covers the change under review and nothing else. It
does not carry to the next task, and never reaches a resource Terraform does
not manage. Asked to prove a rate limit, a session began provisioning a load
generator VM and its VPC; Phase 11 spent a slice deleting the last unmanaged
network this project had.

Load tests, failure drills, and anything that puts traffic on the platform
belong to the repo owner. The result is the deliverable, not a step toward one.
Scaffold the worklog and leave the numbers blank.

A plan that replaces infrastructure is a finding, not a formality. Say so.

Never merge, approve, force push a shared branch, or weaken a check.

## A green check is not evidence

Confirm what a check examined, not that it passed. `check-docs.sh` reads
`git ls-files`, so it skips a file you have not staged. `kubeconform` runs with
`-ignore-missing-schemas`, so every CRD passes unvalidated and a misspelled
policy field applies cleanly and does nothing. CI has reported three passing
checks against a commit two behind the branch head.

The same standard governs what you write. Every claim in the README, `plan.md`
and the worklogs has a command and its output behind it. Give the number, not
the adjective.

## Changes

Branch names and commit subjects both take a Conventional Commits type. The
name describes the change, not its author.

Squash merge rewrites SHAs, so a branch built on another must be rebased once
its base lands, and never merged while its base is anything but `main`.

## Where writing goes

`plan.md` is what will happen, `decisions.md` is why, `worklog/` is what
happened, `reference/` is how something works.

## Conventions

Comments are one line or absent. The bar is not "is this true" but "does the
code already say this".

Keap writing style consisten with what already is in the repository, 
avaid long paragraphs, prefer bullets and tables where suitable.
