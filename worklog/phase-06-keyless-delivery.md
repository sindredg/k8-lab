# Worklog: Phase 6 Keyless Application Delivery

Date: 2026-09-03  
Status: Complete

## Goal

Deploy the frontend image from GitHub Actions without a stored service account key, and stop the workflow when the rollout does not succeed.

## Why the manual step was a gap

Phase 5 ended with the image referenced by digest, but built and pushed by hand from a workstation.

- The workstation is an amd64 cluster's only supplier of images, and it is an arm64 machine. That mismatch is what produced the pull failure recorded in the [troubleshooting log](../troubleshooting.md#an-image-pull-fails-with-notfound-although-the-digest-exists).
- A deployment nobody can reproduce is not a deployment procedure.
- The obvious automation, a downloaded service account key in a GitHub secret, is a permanent bearer credential. Anyone who reads it is the pipeline until someone notices.

## Slice 1: Federate GitHub into the project

Status: Complete

### Implemented

- Added a `delivery` Terraform module creating a Workload Identity Pool and an OIDC provider trusting GitHub's issuer.
- Mapped `assertion.sub`, `assertion.repository`, and `assertion.ref` as provider attributes.
- Set an `attribute_condition` restricting the provider to this repository.
- Created a dedicated `k8-lab-deploy` service account and allowed pool members carrying this repository's attribute to impersonate it.
- Granted `roles/artifactregistry.writer` scoped to the `k8-lab` repository, and `roles/container.clusterViewer` at the project.
- Enabled the Security Token Service and IAM Credentials APIs.

### Why the attribute condition is not optional

The provider trusts an issuer, and every public repository on GitHub receives tokens from that same issuer. A provider with an attribute mapping and no condition therefore accepts a validly signed token from a repository an attacker created.

```hcl
attribute_condition = "assertion.repository == '${var.github_repository}'"
```

The condition is what narrows "signed by GitHub" to "signed by GitHub, for this repository". Federation guides frequently omit it, and the resulting provider is an open door that looks configured.

The impersonation binding uses `principalSet://` rather than `principal://`, so it names every identity sharing the repository attribute rather than one exact workflow on one branch. The branch and the workflow will change over this project's life; the repository will not.

### Validation

Status: Passed

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform fmt -recursive
terraform -chdir=terraform init
terraform -chdir=terraform plan
terraform -chdir=terraform apply
```

![Eight resources added and nothing destroyed](../images/delivery-apply-complete.png)

Result: the pool, the provider, the service account, three IAM bindings, and the two API enablements were created.

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform output workload_identity_provider
terraform -chdir=terraform output deploy_service_account_email
```

Both values were stored as repository **variables** rather than secrets.

![The provider path and account email stored as variables](../images/delivery-repository-variables.png)

Neither is a credential. The provider name is a public resource path and the account email is an identifier; possessing them grants nothing without a signed token from this repository. Storing them as secrets would mask them in logs, making federation failures materially harder to diagnose, and would imply the pipeline holds something worth stealing. It does not, which is the point of the phase.

## Slice 2: Cluster access for the pipeline identity

Status: Complete

### Implemented

- Added `kubernetes/nginx/rbac-deploy.yml`, a namespaced `Role` and `RoleBinding` in `demo`.
- Granted `get`, `list`, `watch`, and `patch` on Deployments; read access to ReplicaSets; and create, read, and delete on Pods and Pod logs.
- Bound the Role to the deploy service account's email as an RBAC `User` subject.

### Two systems must both agree

Google IAM decides whether the pipeline can *reach* the cluster. Kubernetes RBAC decides what it may *do* once inside. `roles/container.clusterViewer` from Slice 1 covers only the first, deliberately: it lets the runner discover the cluster and fetch credentials, and grants almost nothing through the Kubernetes API.

The verb list is short enough to audit at a glance, and each absent line is a decision. There is no `create` or `delete` on Deployments, so a compromised workflow cannot replace the workload with its own. There is no rule for Secrets. There is no access to any namespace but `demo`.

### The pipeline cannot grant itself permission

The manifest is applied from a workstation, by a human, before the first workflow run. This bootstrapping step is a permanent property of the design rather than a one-off inconvenience, and it is the property that keeps the pipeline from widening its own access.

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/nginx/rbac-deploy.yml
```

### Validation

Status: Passed

`kubectl auth can-i` answers for another subject with `--as`, which asks the API server the same questions the pipeline will ask without running the pipeline.

```bash
SA=k8-lab-deploy@project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69.iam.gserviceaccount.com

kubectl auth can-i create pods        -n demo --as="$SA"
kubectl auth can-i patch deployments  -n demo --as="$SA"
kubectl auth can-i delete deployments -n demo --as="$SA"
kubectl auth can-i get secrets        -n demo --as="$SA"
kubectl auth can-i patch deployments  -n kube-system --as="$SA"
```

![Two permissions granted and three refused](../images/delivery-rbac-can-i.png)

Result: `yes`, `yes`, `no`, `no`, `no`. The three refusals are what this slice exists to produce. A `yes` on any of them would mean a `ClusterRole` had been bound where a `Role` was intended.

## Slice 3: The delivery workflow

Status: Complete

### Implemented

- Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, triggered by a push to `main` touching `app/**` or the workflow itself.
- Granted the job `contents: read` and `id-token: write`.
- Authenticated through the federated provider, with no key material anywhere in the run.
- Built for `linux/amd64` explicitly and pushed under a tag carrying the commit, run ID, and attempt.
- Fetched cluster credentials through the DNS control plane endpoint.
- Set the Deployment image to the digest the build produced, waited for the rollout, and ran a smoke test from inside the cluster.

### Why this is a separate workflow

Phase 3 recorded that the validation workflow gets `contents: read` and no cloud identity, and that the absence of a token-minting permission is what makes it verifiably unable to reach the project. Adding `id-token: write` to `ci.yml` would erase that property for every pull request, including ones from forks. Delivery therefore lives in its own file and `ci.yml` is untouched.

### The tag has to be unique per run

The repository sets `immutable_tags`, so a tag of `${{ github.sha }}` alone works exactly once. Re-running the workflow on the same commit is refused, because that tag already names different bytes. The tag carries the run ID and attempt so every execution is distinct.

```yaml
tags: ${{ env.IMAGE }}:${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}.${{ github.run_attempt }}
```

The tag remains a label for a reader. The digest is what the Deployment is set to.

### The smoke test inherits two earlier phases

The test Pod carries `nginx-client=true` because Phase 4 added a default-deny NetworkPolicy, and `nginx-client-allow-egress` is the rule that lets it open the connection. It declares a full `securityContext` because Phase 5 raised the namespace to `restricted`. Removing either makes the test fail for a reason unrelated to the image being verified.

### Validation

Status: Passed

The first end-to-end run authenticated, built, pushed, fetched credentials, and completed the rollout. The smoke test failed.

![Every step green up to the smoke test](../images/delivery-first-run.png)

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

![Both replicas running the newly built digest](../images/delivery-pods-running.png)

Result: two replicas `1/1 Running` on `sha256:33553c115ce7…`, the digest the pipeline had just built. The delivery path worked; the verification step did not.

Two faults surfaced on the way, both recorded in the troubleshooting log: a [transient reset during the token exchange](../troubleshooting.md#a-federated-token-exchange-fails-with-econnreset) and a [smoke Pod that could not start under `runAsNonRoot`](../troubleshooting.md#a-container-will-not-start-because-its-user-is-a-name-rather-than-a-number).

Once the smoke test was corrected, a clean run completed in 1m 9s.

## Slice 4: Prove the claims

Status: Passed

### There is no key

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list \
  --iam-account=k8-lab-deploy@project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --managed-by=user
```

![No user managed keys on the deploy account](../images/delivery-no-user-keys.png)

Result: `Listed 0 items.` The `--managed-by=user` filter is the important part. Every service account holds Google-managed signing keys it cannot function without, and those cannot be downloaded. A user-managed key is the thing this phase exists to avoid, and none exists.

### A failed rollout stops delivery

An untested failure path is an assumption. The probe location in `app/default.conf` was deliberately renamed so the readiness probe would return `404`, and the change was merged.

![The deliberate failure merged to main](../images/delivery-failure-test-merged.png)

![The rollout timing out after three minutes](../images/delivery-rollout-timeout.png)

Result: the build and push succeeded, the new Pod never became Ready, and `kubectl rollout status` exited non-zero after its timeout. The smoke test never ran and the job stopped there. No extra logic produces this; a non-zero exit fails the job and every later step is skipped.

Throughout the failed rollout both existing Pods stayed `1/1 Running`. `maxUnavailable: 0` makes a failed rollout a stalled rollout rather than an outage, which is the same property that kept the site serving through the Phase 5 image failure.

### Recovery is the same path

Reverting the probe location and merging restored the service through the ordinary pipeline, with no manual `kubectl` at any point.

![The revert merged](../images/delivery-recovery-merged.png)

![The recovery run succeeding on main](../images/delivery-recovery-run.png)

The failure run and the recovery run together are the evidence for the "rollout is controlled" claim in the plan.

### Evidence against the plan's claims

| Claim | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery is keyless | Empty user-managed key listing, plus a successful run whose authenticate step reads no key |
| Trust is scoped | The `attribute_condition` and `principalSet` member in the applied Terraform |
| Privilege is least | Five `kubectl auth can-i` answers, three of them `no` |
| Rollout is controlled | The timed-out rollout, both replicas surviving it, and the recovery run |
| Onboarding is repeatable | A push to `main` deploys in about 1m 9s with no local tooling |

## Known gaps

- The digest in `kubernetes/nginx/deployment.yml` no longer matches what runs, because the pipeline sets the image directly. Git describes the workload's shape; the cluster holds the current version. A controller reconciling from git closes this, and that is not this phase.
- The pipeline updates the image only. Changing the Deployment's probes, resources, or any other manifest still needs a manual `kubectl apply`.
- Nothing verifies that the image the pipeline deployed is the image the pipeline built. Binary Authorization closes that gap and is a phase of its own.
- The smoke test asserts that `/healthz` answers. It does not assert that the page itself is correct, so a build that serves a broken page with a working probe would pass.
