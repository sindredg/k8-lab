# Architecture Decisions

Decisions are grouped by domain. Each entry records what was chosen, why, what it costs when the cost is not obvious, and what was rejected. Entries keep that order and stay short: the worklog carries the narrative, this file carries the choice.

## Cluster

### Cluster operating mode

Decision: [GKE Standard](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/choose-cluster-mode) with separately managed node pools.

Why: Provides direct control over nodes, scaling, networking, and upgrades.

Alternatives: [GKE Autopilot](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview).

### Cluster availability

Decision: [Zonal cluster](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-zonal-cluster) in `europe-north1-a`.

Why: Keeps the initial topology and baseline resource usage small.

Alternatives: [Regional cluster](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-regional-cluster).

### Node pool

Decision: [One autoscaling general node pool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-pools) with `e2-standard-2` nodes, 50 GB balanced disks, and a total size of two to three nodes.

Why: Provides predictable baseline capacity with room to scale. The floor is two rather than one so that an evicted Pod has somewhere to land, which is what makes a disruption budget pace a drain instead of blocking it.

Alternatives: [Other machine families](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource), [Spot VMs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/spot-vms), or [node auto-provisioning](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-auto-provisioning).

### Node security

Decision: [Shielded GKE Nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/shielded-gke-nodes) with a dedicated node service account.

Why: Hardens node boot integrity and avoids using the default Compute Engine identity.

Alternatives: [Default Compute Engine service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account).

### Upgrade policy

Decision: [Regular release channel](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels) with node auto-upgrade, auto-repair, and surge upgrades, inside a daily [maintenance window](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions) at 01:00 UTC.

Why: Balances release freshness with stability and reduces upgrade disruption. The window makes node replacement predictable rather than whenever the channel reaches the cluster, which matters because auto-upgrade and auto-repair evict Pods without asking.

Alternatives: [Rapid, Stable, or Extended channels](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels).

### Replica placement

Decision: Spread replicas across nodes with a `topologySpreadConstraints` rule set to `ScheduleAnyway`, paired with a [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) of `minAvailable: 1` on each workload.

Why: A required rule would leave the second replica `Pending` whenever the pool sits at its floor, turning a resilience measure into an outage. With `maxSkew: 1` across exactly two nodes, `DoNotSchedule` would also refuse to reschedule during a drain, because the surviving node would sit at skew 2. The preference keeps replicas apart during the node replacements the Regular channel performs underneath a running workload.

Cost: The budget had to wait for the node floor. On a pool that can scale to one node, `minAvailable` blocks the drain an automatic upgrade depends on, so the floor of two and the budgets shipped as one change.

Alternatives: Required anti-affinity, or accepting co-located replicas.

## Networking

### VPC and IP allocation

Decision: [VPC-native cluster](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alias-ips) with a custom VPC, `10.10.0.0/20` for nodes, and `10.20.0.0/16` for Pods.

Why: Provides explicit, routable, and non-overlapping address allocation.

Alternatives: [GKE-managed secondary ranges](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips) or [Shared VPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-shared-vpc-network).

### Service addresses

Decision: [GKE-managed Service range](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alias-ips).

Why: Avoids reserving an additional subnet secondary range.

Alternatives: [User-managed Service secondary range](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips).

### Node isolation and egress

Decision: [Private nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/latest/network-isolation) with [Cloud NAT](https://docs.cloud.google.com/nat/docs/gke-example).

Why: Removes public node IPs while preserving controlled outbound access.

Alternatives: [Public nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/latest/network-isolation) or [private nodes without general internet egress](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/latest/network-isolation).

### Control plane access

Decision: [DNS-based endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/network-isolation) with direct IP endpoints disabled.

Why: Uses IAM-controlled access without exposing a control plane IP endpoint.

Alternatives: [IP endpoints with authorized networks](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/latest/network-isolation).

### Cluster networking

Decision: [GKE Dataplane V2](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/dataplane-v2).

Why: Provides Cilium-based networking and built-in NetworkPolicy enforcement.

Alternatives: [Calico network policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/network-policy).

## Identity and access

### Workload identity

Decision: [Workload Identity Federation for GKE](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity).

Why: Gives workloads short-lived identities without service account keys.

Alternatives: [Service account impersonation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) or [service account keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).

### Workload service account

Decision: A dedicated Kubernetes ServiceAccount for each workload, with [automountServiceAccountToken](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) disabled.

Why: The namespace default account is shared by every Pod, so any permission granted to it is granted to all of them. NGINX never calls the Kubernetes API, so a mounted token is only attack surface.

Alternatives: [The namespace default ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).

## Workload security

### Pod Security Standards

Decision: [Enforce the restricted standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) on the `demo` namespace, with `warn` and `audit` at the same level, and all three pinned to `v1.35`.

Why: Restricted is the strongest of the three standards and rejects the workload the project no longer runs. Pinning the version stops a cluster upgrade from changing enforcement without a repository change. A standard set to report and never enforced is a standard nobody obeys.

Cost: The level could only be raised once the image stopped running as root. Phase 4 enforced `baseline` for that reason; the Phase 5 image runs as UID 101 and declares the fields the standard requires.

Alternatives: Remain on `baseline`, leave the namespace unlabelled, or add an external policy engine.

### Namespace network isolation

Decision: [Deny all Pod traffic in the `demo` namespace by default](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-ingress-and-all-egress-traffic), then allow cluster DNS for every Pod and HTTP to the NGINX Pods from Pods labelled `nginx-client`. Enforcement comes from [GKE Dataplane V2](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/dataplane-v2), already enabled through `datapath_provider = "ADVANCED_DATAPATH"`, so the legacy `network_policy` block is deliberately absent.

Why: A namespace with no policy lets any Pod in the cluster reach the workload and lets the workload reach anything, including the internet through Cloud NAT. Denying first makes every allowed path a reviewable line in this repository, and a Pod added later is isolated on creation rather than after someone remembers to write a policy for it. Both ends of the application path are declared because the dataplane checks the sender's egress and the receiver's ingress separately.

Cost: The rules have to name Pods exactly. The DNS rule allows both `kube-dns` and `node-local-dns`, because [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/nodelocal-dns-cache) answers on the kube-dns cluster IP but runs as its own Pod labelled `k8s-app: node-local-dns`, so a rule naming only `kube-dns` selects a Pod that never receives the query. Naming the kube-dns Service address instead does not work either: Dataplane V2 rewrites a Service IP to a backend Pod before policy is evaluated, so an `ipBlock` holding that address matches nothing.

Alternatives: Leave the namespace open and rely on Pod Security alone, allow all egress and restrict only ingress, or select clients by namespace instead of by Pod label.

### Namespace boundary between workloads

Decision: Run the second workload in the existing `demo` namespace rather than giving it one of its own.

Why: The namespace is the unit that carries Pod Security enforcement, the default-deny policies, and the resource budget, and all three already apply to any Pod admitted to `demo`. A second namespace would duplicate that scaffolding and add a `ReferenceGrant` so the Gateway could route across the boundary, which is a phase of work rather than a configuration change. Both workloads are owned by the same person and fail together anyway, so the shared blast radius is real but not yet meaningful.

Alternatives: A namespace per workload, which is what genuine multi-tenancy would require and what a third workload should trigger. Recorded as a [deferred decision](#deferred-decision-records).

## Images and supply chain

### Image registry

Decision: Publish images to a regional [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/integrate-gke) repository in the cluster region, created by Terraform alongside the cluster.

Why: A project-owned repository removes the runtime dependency on Docker Hub and its rate limits, and puts the images under the same access control as the rest of the platform. Matching the cluster region keeps pulls off the cross-region path, which costs both latency on every node scale-up and egress charges.

Alternatives: Continue pulling public images at deploy time, use a multi-region repository, or use the deprecated Container Registry.

### Tag immutability

Decision: Set `immutable_tags` on the repository, and deploy by digest rather than by tag.

Why: A tag is a label that can be repointed, so the same manifest can deploy different bytes on different days. A digest is derived from the content and cannot. Immutable tags enforce at the registry what deploying by digest achieves at the manifest, so neither depends on discipline.

Cost: The repository rejects a push to a tag that already exists, which rules out a moving `latest`. Delivery has to tag each build uniquely, by commit SHA.

Alternatives: Rely on convention alone, or allow mutable tags and pin only in the manifest.

### Registry retention

Decision: Delete untagged images after seven days, and keep the ten most recent versions regardless.

Why: Rebuilding content that already exists orphans the previous image, which loses its tag but continues to occupy billable storage. Without a policy, storage grows without bound. The KEEP rule takes precedence over the DELETE rule, so recent images survive even while untagged.

Alternatives: Retain everything, or delete on a fixed schedule with no protection for recent images.

### Base image

Decision: Build on [`nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged`](https://github.com/nginx/docker-nginx-unprivileged) rather than reconfiguring the standard NGINX image to drop privileges.

Why: The image already runs as a non-root user and writes its cache, temporary files, and PID to paths that user owns. Converting the standard image means finding each of those paths and correcting it, and a miss produces a container that starts and then fails on the first request rather than at build time. The upstream image is maintained against the same NGINX releases, so the version stays pinned to the same line the workload already runs.

Alternatives: Reconfigure the standard NGINX image, or build from a distroless base with a different server.

### Listening port

Decision: Serve on port 8080 inside the container, and keep the Service on port 80.

Why: Binding a port below 1024 requires `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, and the `restricted` Pod Security standard requires dropping all capabilities. The two cannot both hold, so the container port moves. The Service keeps port 80 and reaches the container through the named port `http`, so nothing that calls the Service changes.

Cost: The NetworkPolicy rules name the container port, not the Service port, so both have to move with it. That coupling is deliberate and is why the policies name a port at all.

Alternatives: Keep the container on port 80 and grant the capability back, which the enforced standard rejects.

### Image reference in the manifest

Decision: Reference the image by digest rather than by tag, keeping the tag alongside it for readability.

Why: A digest is derived from the image content, so a manifest naming one deploys exactly those bytes for as long as it exists. A tag is a label the registry could in principle move, and reading a manifest tells you nothing about which build a tag pointed at on a given day.

Cost: A digest is unreadable, and nothing in the manifest says which commit produced it. The tag beside it carries that, and delivery writes the digest so there is no manual step.

Alternatives: Deploy by tag and rely on the repository's immutable tags, or deploy by tag and accept the ambiguity.

### Registry access for nodes

Decision: Grant `roles/artifactregistry.reader` to the node service account, scoped to this repository rather than to the project.

Why: Image pulls use the node identity. The kubelet fetches the image before the container exists, so Workload Identity is not available at that point and cannot be used for pulls. Scoping the binding to one repository keeps the nodes from reading every repository the project may later hold.

Cost: The binding is required rather than a precaution, and it is easy to assume otherwise. [`roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/container), already held by the node account, covers logging, monitoring, and autoscaling metrics and grants nothing for Artifact Registry, so pulls fail without it. Guidance stating that nodes can pull without extra roles describes the Compute Engine default service account, which receives broad automatic grants; Phase 1 replaced that account with a dedicated one.

Alternatives: Grant the role at project level.

### Pod identity reported by the page

Decision: Render the Pod name, namespace, Pod IP, node, uid and image digest into the page from the running container, rather than describing them in prose.

Why: The rest of the page makes claims a reader cannot check, and non-root and deployed-by-digest are the two most load-bearing. The uid is read with `id -u` rather than copied from the Pod spec, so it reports what the container is rather than what it was asked to be. The downward API supplies the Pod facts; the image digest cannot come from it, so the pipeline sets it in the same patch that sets the image, and the two cannot drift.

Cost: The page publishes internal names to the internet, which suits a lab whose purpose is to be inspected and would be wrong for a production service. The HTML is no longer static, `sub_filter` runs on every response, and `Cache-Control: no-store` keeps a reload landing on the other replica visible.

Alternatives: Serve the facts as a JSON endpoint, which keeps the page static and puts the evidence where nobody looks. State nothing, which is what a production service should do.

### Application source for the second workload

Decision: Build the sky image here, from [sindredg/aca-prod](https://github.com/sindredg/aca-prod) at a commit pinned in the workflow, rather than vendoring its source or pulling its published image.

Why: Upstream publishes to Azure Container Registry, which this cluster has no credentials for and should not be given any. Rebuilding from a pinned commit keeps the image project-owned, private, and digest-deployed like every other image here, while leaving the application's own repository authoritative. The pin is the review boundary: taking an upstream change is a one-line commit that CI and a rollout then have to accept.

Alternatives: Copy the source into this repository, which forks it and makes upstream fixes a manual port. Or grant this cluster cross-cloud pull credentials, which trades a supply-chain property for convenience.

## Infrastructure and configuration

### Terraform structure

Decision: [Root configuration](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/best-practices/root-modules) composed from local `network` and `gke` modules.

Why: Keeps resource ownership clear while preserving reusable boundaries.

Alternatives: [Google GKE Terraform modules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/terraform).

### Terraform state and automation

Decision: [Local Terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and manual plan review for the current single-operator workflow.

Why: Keeps supporting infrastructure small while the platform is being established.

Alternatives: [Cloud Storage remote state](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/resource-management/store-state) and [Workload Identity Federation for deployment pipelines](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-deployment-pipelines).

### Infrastructure and workload ownership

Decision: Terraform manages Google Cloud infrastructure. Declarative Kubernetes configuration manages in-cluster resources outside the GKE foundation state.

Why: Keeps cluster lifecycle separate from workload lifecycle and avoids coupling Kubernetes provider access to cluster creation or destruction.

Alternatives: [Terraform Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs), [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview), or a shared Terraform state.

### Kubernetes configuration management

Decision: Continue with plain Kubernetes YAML for the current workload. Adopt [Kustomize](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) when environment or workload variants create duplication.

Why: Preserves direct Kubernetes learning and avoids adding templates before there is a real variation to manage.

Alternatives: [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/), Kustomize immediately, or Terraform-managed Kubernetes resources.

## Delivery

### Pipeline sequence

Decision: Add credential-free pull request validation first. Add keyless GitHub Actions delivery through [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-deployment-pipelines) after Artifact Registry and the custom image exist.

Why: Static validation needs no cloud access. Authentication is introduced only when the workflow must push or deploy.

Alternatives: Add cloud credentials to the first CI workflow or install a GitOps controller before the first delivery slice.

### Pull request validation scope

Decision: Validate Terraform formatting and configuration, and validate Kubernetes manifests against the upstream schemas with [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform). Defer YAML and Markdown linting.

Why: The included checks catch configuration that would fail against a real cluster or provider. The deferred checks only enforce formatting and would have required repository-wide cleanup before the first workflow could pass.

Alternatives: Lint everything from the start, or run no validation until delivery is automated.

### Pipeline credentials

Decision: Grant the validation workflow `contents: read` only. Do not grant `id-token: write` or any Google Cloud identity.

Why: The absence of a token-minting permission is what makes the workflow verifiably unable to reach the project.

Alternatives: Attach a deployment identity to the validation workflow.

### Action pinning

Decision: Pin third-party GitHub Actions to a commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment. Pin validator releases to an exact version.

Why: A tag can be moved to different code after review. A commit SHA cannot.

Alternatives: [Pin by tag](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions) and accept the mutable reference.

### Kubernetes security linting

Decision: Run [kube-linter](https://docs.kubelinter.io/) in advisory mode and publish its findings to the run summary. Make it blocking once Phase 4 and Phase 5 close the findings it reports.

Why: Its three current findings need a non-root image and a scheduling decision, which are later phases. A check that cannot pass yet would either block all work or be ignored.

Cost: An advisory check proves nothing on its own, so the gap stays open until Phase 4 makes it blocking.

Alternatives: Enforce the default checks immediately, or configure a reduced check set and enforce that.

### Merge protection

Decision: Require a pull request and both status checks on `main` through a repository ruleset, with no bypass actors.

Why: Validation that can be pushed past is documentation, not enforcement.

Alternatives: Advisory checks only, or an admin bypass for the repository owner.

### Initial delivery model

Decision: Use GitHub Actions for the first application deployment. Evaluate Argo CD and Flux when pull-based reconciliation, drift correction, or multiple environments create a requirement.

Why: One cluster and one workload do not yet justify another continuously running controller and recovery surface.

Alternatives: [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/), or manual deployment.

### Pipeline authentication

Decision: Authenticate GitHub Actions through [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-deployment-pipelines), and create no user-managed service account keys.

Why: A downloaded key is a permanent bearer credential. Anyone who reads it is the pipeline until someone notices and rotates it, and nothing in the key records where it was used. A federated token is minted per run, expires in minutes, and carries the repository, workflow, and ref that requested it.

Cost: Federation is harder to reason about than a key, and its failure modes are less obvious. The [troubleshooting log](troubleshooting.md#a-federated-token-exchange-fails-with-econnreset) records the first one encountered.

Alternatives: A service account key in a GitHub secret, or a self-hosted runner holding an attached identity.

### Federation trust boundary

Decision: Restrict the OIDC provider with an `attribute_condition` on `assertion.repository`, and bind impersonation to a `principalSet://` naming that same attribute.

Why: The provider trusts GitHub's issuer, and every repository on GitHub receives tokens from that issuer. Without a condition, a validly signed token from any repository is accepted, including one an attacker creates. The condition is what narrows "signed by GitHub" to "signed by GitHub, for this repository". `principalSet` rather than `principal` binds every workflow in the repository rather than one exact subject, because the branch and workflow will change over this project's life and the repository will not.

Alternatives: Scope trust to a branch or environment as well, which is stricter and breaks on every branch rename.

### Pipeline authorization

Decision: Grant the pipeline identity `roles/container.clusterViewer` at the project, and a namespaced Kubernetes `Role` in `demo` for everything it actually does.

Why: Google IAM decides whether the pipeline can reach the cluster; Kubernetes RBAC decides what it may do inside. Splitting them keeps the project-level grant to discovery only. The Role has no `create` or `delete` on Deployments, no access to Secrets, and no reach outside `demo`, and it is short enough that a reviewer can check it in seconds.

Cost: The Role must be applied by a human before the first run, because the pipeline cannot create its own permissions. That bootstrapping step is the property that stops the pipeline widening its own access.

Alternatives: `roles/container.developer`, which is one line of Terraform and grants read and write on every object in every cluster in the project.

### Delivery workflow separation

Decision: Deliver from a second workflow rather than adding credentials to `ci.yml`.

Why: The validation workflow's claim is that it holds `contents: read` and cannot reach the project at all. Adding `id-token: write` would erase that for every pull request, including ones from forks. The claim is worth more than one fewer file.

Alternatives: A single workflow with conditional steps, or a reusable workflow called by both.

### Deployment update method

Decision: Render this run's digest into `deployment.yml` with `kubectl set image --local` and apply the result, instead of patching the live Deployment.

Why: A patch only ever changed the fields it named. Every other edit to `deployment.yml` merged to `main` and never reached the cluster, which is how a Deployment declaring five environment variables ran with one. Applying carries the image and the rest of the manifest in the same rollout, and an apply that changes nothing is a no-op.

Cost: Only the Deployment is applied. The namespace, quotas, policies and routes stay manual, because letting the pipeline apply them means granting it authority over its own RBAC.

Alternatives: Apply the whole directory, which needs a far broader Role. Keep patching and apply by hand, which is what failed.

### Image reference at deploy time

Decision: Have the pipeline set the Deployment's image to the digest it just built, rather than committing the digest back to the repository.

Why: One source of change and no commit loop. The workflow needs no write access to the repository.

Cost: The digest in `kubernetes/nginx/deployment.yml` no longer matches what runs. Git describes the workload's shape; the cluster holds the current version. A controller reconciling from git closes this, and the [deferred decision](#deferred-decision-records) on Argo CD and Flux is where that is settled.

Alternatives: Commit the digest back to `main`, or substitute a placeholder at deploy time.

## Ingress and TLS

### Ingress mechanism

Decision: Publish through a `Gateway` on `gke-l7-global-external-managed` rather than an Ingress object.

Why: Routing is expressed in the API rather than in annotations. A redirect, a hostname and a backend are typed fields, so the configuration says what it does and CI can check its shape. Gateway API is also where GKE's load balancer features are being added, and Ingress is where they are not.

Cost: The GKE extensions are proprietary CRDs. `HealthCheckPolicy` has no public schema, so `kubeconform` skips it with `-ignore-missing-schemas` and CI validates everything except the one file most likely to be wrong.

Alternatives: An Ingress with GKE annotations, which is better documented and worse to read.

### Load balancer backend target

Decision: Let the Gateway controller build a network endpoint group and leave the `nginx` Service `ClusterIP`.

Why: This is what allows both halves of the phase to hold at once. The load balancer reaches Pod IP and port pairs directly, and the Service is used only to work out which Pods belong in the group. Publishing the workload therefore changes the path into the cluster rather than the exposure of the Service.

Cost: The hop the load balancer makes is invisible to Kubernetes. A Pod is reachable from Google's proxies whether or not any Service would route to it, so Pod-level policy is the only thing standing between the internet and the container.

Alternatives: `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, both of which publish the Service itself and forfeit the claim.

### External address ownership

Decision: Reserve a global external address in Terraform and have the `Gateway` name it through `addresses.type: NamedAddress`.

Why: The address outlives any Gateway object using it. DNS points at a value Terraform owns, so deleting and recreating the Gateway does not change where the domain resolves, and the manifest carries a name rather than an IP.

Cost: One more resource, and a reserved address bills whether or not a load balancer is attached.

Alternatives: Let the controller allocate an ephemeral address, which changes on recreation and makes the DNS record a moving target.

### Certificate delivery

Decision: Attach certificates with the `networking.gke.io/certmap` annotation, pointing at a Certificate Manager map.

Why: Renewal is Google's problem and no key material is in the repository. The map is indirection that earns itself: one Gateway can serve several certificates chosen by hostname, and swapping a certificate is an entry change rather than a Gateway change.

Cost: Three resources where a Secret is one, and `hostname` on a map entry is immutable, so changing the name a certificate serves replaces the entry.

Alternatives: A TLS Secret listed in the listener, which puts renewal and private keys back on us.

### Domain validation method

Decision: Prove domain control with a DNS authorization.

Why: It decouples issuance from the cutover. A valid certificate can exist before the domain points anywhere, so the certificate is not blocked on DNS and DNS is not blocked on the certificate. Load balancer authorization checks the live load balancer at that name, which requires the cutover to have already happened.

Cost: One extra record, permanently, because renewal re-checks it.

Alternatives: Load balancer authorization, which needs no record and orders the work the wrong way round.

### DNS authorization record type

Decision: Issue the managed certificate against a `PER_PROJECT_RECORD` DNS authorization, validating at `_acme-challenge_<hash>.sindrg.com` rather than the default `_acme-challenge.sindrg.com`.

Why: Cloudflare serves its own hidden `TXT` records at `_acme-challenge` for Universal SSL. A name holding both a `CNAME` and a `TXT` answers `TXT` queries from the `TXT` set alone, so validation never followed the `CNAME` to Google and the certificate failed with `CONFIG` on every attempt. A per-project label is not contested by anything.

Cost: The challenge record's name is generated rather than predictable, so it cannot be written before the authorization exists. `type` is immutable, so changing it later replaces the authorization, the certificate and the map entry together.

Alternatives: Disable Cloudflare's Universal SSL, which removes the conflicting records but is console state rather than configuration and may be reprovisioned. Move DNS to Cloud DNS, which removes the conflict and the registrar's edge features with it.

### Redirect to HTTPS

Decision: Answer plain HTTP with a `301` from a second `HTTPRoute` attached to the HTTP listener, rather than redirecting in NGINX.

Why: No request reaches a Pod in clear text. Google answers on port 80 and the container never sees an unencrypted request, so the redirect cannot be lost by changing the image or its configuration.

Cost: Two routes and a listener kept open only to redirect. The main route binds to `sectionName: https`, so it cannot attach until the HTTPS listener exists.

Alternatives: Redirect inside NGINX, which lets clear-text requests into the Pod, or close port 80, which breaks anyone typing the bare domain.

### Load balancer health checks

Decision: Point the load balancer's health check at `/healthz` on port 8080 through a `HealthCheckPolicy`, mirroring the Kubernetes probes.

Why: The default check fetches `/`, so the backend's health becomes a property of the page's content. A dedicated endpoint keeps the check about whether the server is serving.

Cost: A GKE-proprietary CRD with no public schema, so CI cannot validate it. A wrong field here surfaces as unhealthy backends rather than a failed apply.

Alternatives: Accept the default check on `/`, which passes for the wrong reasons and fails for them too.

### Health check source range

Decision: Allow ingress to the Pods from `130.211.0.0/22` and `35.191.0.0/16` with an `ipBlock`.

Why: The default-deny policy drops the health checks, and no `podSelector` can express the source, because Google's proxies are not Pods and hold no identity in the cluster. An address range is the only form the API can state.

Cost: The coarsest control that works. Every Google Cloud customer's proxies originate in those ranges, so this admits a network location rather than a caller.

Alternatives: None within NetworkPolicy. Filtering by caller belongs to Cloud Armor, which is a phase of its own.

### Second workload routing

Decision: Serve the sky workload at `/sky` on the existing hostname, routing `/sky` with its prefix rewritten away and routing `/api` and `/static` to it unchanged. The load balancer reaches `/health` through the `HealthCheckPolicy` rather than through a route.

Why: The application is not prefix aware. Its page asks for `/static/app.js` and its script fetches `/api/places`, both absolute, so the prefix cannot be confined to `/sky` without changing the application. Gateway API matches the longest prefix first, so these rules take precedence over the project page's `/` without either route referring to the other.

Cost: Rewriting a prefix away exposes everything behind it, so `/sky/health` and `/sky/version` are both public. `/sky/version` returns the upstream commit the image was built from, which is a fact about a public repository rather than a secret, but it is a consequence of the rewrite worth stating rather than discovering.

Alternatives: A `sky.` subdomain, which keeps each workload's path namespace whole at the cost of a DNS record and a certificate map entry, and remains the answer if a second application ever wants `/api`. Or patch a vendored copy to be prefix-clean, which forks the application to solve a routing problem.

## Observability

### Telemetry scope

Decision: Declare `SYSTEM_COMPONENTS` and `WORKLOADS` logging and `SYSTEM_COMPONENTS` monitoring with Managed Service for Prometheus, and leave `API_SERVER`, `SCHEDULER`, and `CONTROLLER_MANAGER` off.

Why: Container stdout is the largest ingest line on a cluster this size and Cloud Logging bills it, so keeping `WORKLOADS` is a cost decision rather than a free one. The control plane streams answer "who changed this object", and are noisy and billable for everything else. Writing the scope down also turned an inherited default into a recorded choice, which the first plan proved by proposing a change rather than an empty diff.

Alternatives: Accept the GKE defaults unwritten, or enable every control plane stream.

### Availability signal

Decision: Alert on a [Cloud Monitoring uptime check](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks) against `/healthz` from three prober regions every 60 seconds, with a content matcher requiring `ok` and `validate_ssl` enabled.

Why: This platform has close to no organic traffic, so a condition on the load balancer's 5xx ratio evaluates an empty series at the moment an outage begins, and silence is indistinguishable from a quiet night. The check produces the traffic it alerts on, so it is both the load and the signal. Matching body content means a `200` from something that is not this workload still fails, and `validate_ssl` makes the same check an expiry alarm for a certificate that renews unattended.

Alternatives: Alert on load balancer response classes or backend health, which only fire when there is traffic to observe.

### Alert threshold

Decision: Open an incident only when more than one checker location is failing, and set `auto_close` to 30 minutes.

Why: One location failing is a network path somewhere on the internet, and paging on it is how an alert teaches its reader to dismiss it. Requiring two costs nothing in detection here: one zonal cluster behind one global load balancer has no partial-failure mode, so a real outage fails every location inside the same check period. The default `auto_close` of seven days would leave a self-recovered incident open when the next real one arrives.

Alternatives: Page on a single failing location, or on a proportion of locations.

## Load and scaling

### Workload autoscaling

Decision: A `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` on sky, scaling on CPU utilization at 70% of the request with a minimum of two replicas. The replica count leaves the Deployment manifest.

Why: uvicorn serves each Pod from one process, so CPU tracks load closely and the metric is already collected. The minimum of two keeps the spread and the disruption budget intact at rest. nginx serves a static page and is not the bottleneck.

Cost: Utilization is measured against the request, so a low request scales on almost no load, and `limits.cpu` in the quota caps the replica count before node capacity does. The pipeline applies the Deployment, so `replicas` has to leave both the manifest and its last-applied record, or a deploy resets the count. The pipeline Role cannot create the HPA, so an operator applies it.

Alternatives: Fixed replicas. Requests per second through a custom metrics adapter. The [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/verticalpodautoscaler), which resizes Pods rather than adding them and restarts them to do it.

### Scaling telemetry

Decision: Add the `CADVISOR`, `HPA`, `DEPLOYMENT` and `POD` packages to Managed Service for Prometheus.

Why: The failure modes this phase predicts are invisible in the existing metrics. A quota stall is desired replicas diverging from available ones, and a throttled Pod looks idle against its limit while it queues requests. Both become series on the dashboard rather than lines in a terminal.

Cost: The packages bill per sample ingested, so the weekly cost is measured again after they are enabled.

Alternatives: The `kubectl` recorder alone, which captures stalls and misses throttling.

### Load test tool

Decision: [k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/), with arrival-rate executors and a threshold on each fixed-rate step.

Why: A closed-loop tool such as `hey`, `ab` or `wrk` waits for each response before sending the next request, so a slowing server receives less load and its latency is under-reported. An arrival-rate executor holds the rate regardless of response time. k6 evaluates a threshold over the whole run, so a single ramp trips long after the point of saturation; a threshold per step makes that point the last step that passes. The scripts live in the repository, so every run uses the same test.

Alternatives: vegeta or wrk2, which hold a rate and script poorly. Locust or JMeter, which model user journeys this platform does not have.

### Saturation criterion

Decision: A ramp step fails when p95 latency exceeds 500ms or errors exceed 1%, and the run stops at the first failing step.

Why: Stopping at the point of saturation measures capacity without holding the platform in overload while the uptime alert is armed.

Alternatives: A fixed ramp to a fixed peak, which compares more simply and overloads the platform on every run.

### Load source

Decision: Generate load from one `e2-standard-2` VM in `europe-west4`, on a throwaway VPC with SSH through IAP only, created and deleted with gcloud each session.

Why: A laptop on a home connection varies between runs and can saturate before the workload does. A nearby region keeps round-trip time small enough that latency changes belong to the platform, while traffic still arrives through the public load balancer. A separate VPC keeps the load source outside the platform network, and deleting it leaves `gke-vpc` as the only network.

Cost: The VM and its network are console state rather than configuration, so the runbook is what keeps each session's generator identical. The project holds a second network for the length of a session.

Alternatives: A laptop, which is free and unrepeatable. A Terraform-managed VM, which is reproducible and adds a module for a resource that lives for hours. A subnet on `gke-vpc`, which puts unmanaged resources in the Terraform-owned network.

### Alerting during load tests

Decision: Keep the uptime alert armed during every run.

Why: A page caused by load is evidence that the availability alert catches overload as well as an outage. Snoozing it tests a platform with its alerting removed.

Cost: A step pushed past saturation can open an incident. Stopping at the first failing step keeps that window short.

Alternatives: Snooze the alert for each run window.

## Project and process

### Project focus

Decision: Build a secure GCP hosted Kubernetes workload platform. Host an interesting custom workload on it.

Why: Keeps cloud and Kubernetes engineering as the primary work while providing a concrete workload to prove the platform.

Alternatives: Build an [application-first AI service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview) or a dedicated self-hosted AI platform.

### First platform milestone

Decision: Extend the existing NGINX workload into one complete vertical slice before adding the AI workload or broader platform features.

Why: Reuses the deployed cluster, manifests, validation, and evidence while keeping the first milestone complete and testable.

Alternatives: Implement networking, policy, delivery, observability, and AI as separate horizontal workstreams.

### Evidence requirement

Decision: A capability is complete only after its success path, relevant failure path, and recovery are recorded.

Why: Demonstrates that the platform works rather than only showing that resources exist.

Alternatives: Treat deployment completion or configuration review as sufficient evidence.

### Cost posture

Decision: Use the available GCP credits for hands-on testing, keep the zonal cluster available during active work, and provision regional capacity only for targeted validation.

Why: Prioritizes learning and evidence while still measuring actual costs and avoiding unnecessary GPU or regional runtime.

Alternatives: Destroy the cluster after every session or keep a regional production cluster running throughout development.

### Deferred decision records

Create short entries when these decision gates are reached:

- Native controls versus Kyverno or Gatekeeper
- GitHub Actions versus Argo CD or Flux for continued delivery
- Standard GKE features versus fleet and multi-cluster components
- Vertex AI versus self-hosted inference
- One namespace for every workload versus a namespace per workload, when a third workload or a second owner arrives
