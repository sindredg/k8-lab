# Worklog: Phase 15 Security Command Center triage

Date: 2026-09-20
Status: In progress. Findings reach the subscription in about two seconds and park in the dead letter topic when nothing acknowledges them. No findings are triaged, and no worker exists.

## Goal

Read the findings Security Command Center has produced since 2026-09-18, correlate them against this repository's own records, and notify through the existing email channel. See [Phase 15](../plan.md#phase-15-security-command-center-triage). The contract the work is held to was settled first, in [#113](https://github.com/sindredg/k8-lab/pull/113).

This worklog covers the infrastructure and the transport. The overlap measurement the exit criteria name is open, both exit-criteria drills are open, and the agent source in [ai-k8s](https://github.com/sindredg/ai-k8s) is empty.

The transport changed no decision and added evidence to two. [Triage idempotency](../decisions.md#triage-idempotency) now carries what `eventTime` was measured to track, and the warning that a finding cannot be written back at the name it is read at.

## What the findings look like before anything reads them

Read at project scope, filtered on state, because an earlier read that ignored state counted four retired findings as live:

```bash
gcloud scc findings list projects/421458901689 --location=global \
  --format='value(finding.state,finding.category,finding.eventTime)' \
  | grep -viE 'SOFTWARE_|OS_VULN' | sort
```

```

Six active misconfigurations, two external exposures, one threat finding, and 653 vulnerability findings not shown. The four `INACTIVE` ones all name `loadgen` resources in `europe-west4`. Security Command Center raised them at 17:02 on 2026-09-18 and retired them at 17:27, when the load generator and its VPC were deleted, which is the cost posture being honoured and the detector tracking it. They are kept here because they are the proof that one finding produces more than one event, which is why the worker keys on state as well as event time.

## The overlap, read by hand

Not the measurement the exit criteria ask for. That one is produced by the worker with provenance. This is the hand check that says whether the phase is pointed at anything real.

```bash
grep -rn "CKV_GCP_13\"\|CKV_GCP_20\"\|CKV_GCP_61\"\|CKV_GCP_65\"\|CKV_GCP_66\"" \
  ~/.local/share/pipx/venvs/checkov/lib/python3.12/site-packages/checkov/terraform/checks/
```

```text
GKEClientCertificateDisabled.py:8:        id = "CKV_GCP_13"
GKEMasterAuthorizedNetworksEnabled.py:9:  id = "CKV_GCP_20"
GKEEnableVPCFlowLogs.py:10:               id = "CKV_GCP_61"
GKEBinaryAuthorization.py:8:              id = "CKV_GCP_66"
GKEKubernetesRBACGoogleGroups.py:9:       id = "CKV_GCP_65"
```

| Active finding | Priced in `.checkov.baseline` |
| --- | --- |
| `MASTER_AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS_DISABLED` | Yes, `CKV_GCP_20` |
| `BINARY_AUTHORIZATION_DISABLED` | Yes, `CKV_GCP_66`, and threat model finding 10 |
| `CLUSTER_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_DISABLED` | No |
| `INTRANODE_VISIBILITY_DISABLED` | No |
| `NON_ORG_IAM_MEMBER` | No |
| `PRIMITIVE_ROLES_USED` | No |

Two of six. [Phase 14](phase-14-close-the-baseline.md) expected high overlap and wrote that its value would be "the remainder plus the threat detection nothing else here provides". The remainder is two thirds.

Worth recording how this was nearly got wrong. A first pass paired `CLUSTER_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_DISABLED` with `CKV_GCP_65` and `INTRANODE_VISIBILITY_DISABLED` with `CKV_GCP_61` on the strength of the names, and reported four of six. `CKV_GCP_65` is RBAC Google Groups and `CKV_GCP_61` is VPC flow logs. Neither pairing exists. That error is why the contract in [#113](https://github.com/sindredg/k8-lab/pull/113) requires every verdict to cite a corpus entry and requires the worker to resolve the citation before accepting the verdict.

## Slice 1: The certificate that was nearly replaced

Status: Closed. The cause is removed and a guard is in place.

`terraform apply` planned `7 to add, 1 to change, 1 to destroy`. The destroy was the certificate serving the public domain. It failed:

```text
Error: Error when reading or editing Certificate: googleapi: Error 400: can't
delete certificate that is referenced by a CertificateMapEntry or other resources
    "subject": "projects/421458901689/locations/global/certificates/k8-lab-gateway-cert",
    "type": "RESOURCE_STILL_IN_USE"
```

![Certificate Manager refusing the delete](../images/phase15-certificate-destroy-refused.png)

Nothing was destroyed and nothing was created; the apply stopped on its first operation. The site never stopped serving:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://sindrg.com/healthz
```

```text
HTTP 200
```

The cause was four API names. `module.gateway` carries `depends_on = [google_project_service.required]`. This phase added `aiplatform`, `pubsub`, `securitycenter` and `storage` to that set, so the module depended on a resource with pending changes, so Terraform deferred reading `data.google_project.this` until apply, so `.number` was unknown at plan time. It is interpolated into `dns_authorizations`, which is `ForceNew`:

```hcl
dns_authorizations = [
  "projects/${data.google_project.this.number}/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/...",
]
```

The project number is a constant and was identical before and after. Terraform could not prove that, so it planned a replacement. Any edit to `required_services` by anyone would have done the same.

The fix passes the number in as a variable, so it is known at plan time, and removes the data source in both the gateway module and the new findings module, which had the same pattern waiting on its IAM members. After it:

```text
Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Only Certificate Manager's own refusal stopped this, which is luck rather than a control, so the certificate now carries `prevent_destroy`. A replacement has to be a deliberate act.

## Slice 2: The alert filter that could not be left open

Status: Closed, and a decision recorded in the plan was wrong.

The alert policy was written with no `resource.type` clause, deliberately. The reasoning was that no worker had written a log entry yet, so naming the type would be a guess, and a wrong guess fails silently. Cloud Monitoring does not allow the choice:

```text
Error: Error creating AlertPolicy: googleapi: Error 400: Field
alert_policy.conditions[0].condition_threshold.filter had an invalid value of
"metric.type = "logging.googleapis.com/user/triage/verdicts"": must specify a
restriction on "resource.type" in the filter
```

![Cloud Monitoring rejecting a filter with no resource type](../images/phase15-alert-policy-resource-type.png)

`k8s_container` is therefore a contract rather than an observation, and the worker has to set that monitored resource explicitly rather than relying on client library detection.

That contract is measurable now, before the worker exists:

```bash
gcloud logging write triage-verdict \
  '{"verdict":"new","finding":{"category":"PROBE","severity":"LOW"}}' \
  --payload-type=json --severity=WARNING
```

![Writing a verdict shaped log entry by hand](../images/phase15-logging-probe.png)

```bash
gcloud logging read 'logName="projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/logs/triage-verdict"' \
  --limit=1 --format='value(resource.type,jsonPayload.verdict)'
```

```text
global	new
```

A hand written entry lands as `global`. The metric counted it, because the metric filters on `logName` and the verdict only. The alert did not fire, because the alert requires `k8s_container`. So a worker that writes the wrong monitored resource is counted and never paged, which is the silent failure the original reasoning was trying to avoid and the filter now makes explicit.

## Slice 3: The apply that succeeded and reported failure

Status: Closed. The path is applied. Three errors, and two of them were about something other than what they said.

`modules/findings` was written in [#114](https://github.com/sindredg/k8-lab/pull/114) and never called from the root. Terraform does not evaluate a module directory that no configuration calls, so CI's `terraform validate` had been passing for two days without reading a line of it. Wiring it was therefore the first time any of it ran.

Seven of the nine resources created. Then:

```text
Error: Error creating ProjectNotificationConfig: googleapi: Error 403: Your
application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.
The securitycenter.googleapis.com API requires a quota project, which is not
set by default.
    "consumer": "projects/764086051850",
    "reason": "SERVICE_DISABLED"
```

![The 403 naming a project that is not this one](../images/phase15-quota-project-403.png)

`securitycenter.googleapis.com` is enabled in this project, and `764086051850` is not this project. It is Google's shared gcloud client project. Some APIs bill the caller's quota project rather than the resource's, user Application Default Credentials carry no quota project, so the call was billed to Google's own client project, where the API is disabled. The message names the wrong project and the wrong cause.

`gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project` fixes it for one machine. The provider carries it instead:

```hcl
billing_project       = var.project_id
user_project_override = true
```

The next apply produced a different error:

```text
Error: Error creating ProjectNotificationConfig: googleapi: Error 400:
Precondition check failed.
```

![The whole of the second error](../images/phase15-precondition-failed.png)

No precondition named, and nothing about what was already true. Read back from the API rather than from state:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  -H "X-Goog-User-Project: project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69" \
  "https://securitycenter.googleapis.com/v2/projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/locations/global/notificationConfigs"
```

```text
"name": "projects/421458901689/locations/global/notificationConfigs/k8-lab-triage",
"pubsubTopic": "projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/topics/scc-findings",
"updateTime": "2026-09-20T13:21:29.056431Z"
```

The config existed, with the filter and topic the module specifies. The ledger bucket from the first apply reports `creation_time 2026-09-20T13:18:10`, three minutes earlier, which places the config in the second apply rather than the first. So the apply that reported a failure had already done the work, and `400 Precondition check failed` is how Security Command Center answers a create for a config that exists. The obvious response is to run it again, and running it again only reproduces it.

Importing it forced a replacement:

```text
~ project = "421458901689" -> "project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69" # forces replacement
```

![The plan showing a destroy before it ran](../images/phase15-import-replacement.png)

The API returns `project` as the number, the configuration supplies the id, and `project` is `ForceNew`. This is the same project-number-against-project-id mismatch as Slice 1, arriving by a different route: Slice 1 was a value unknown at plan time, this is two spellings of a known one. The plan showed the replacement before it ran, which is the only reason it was a decision rather than a surprise.

It is an import artifact and not standing drift. After the replacement, the provider keeps the configured value:

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -detailed-exitcode; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
EXIT=0
```

What each error said against what it meant:

| Reported | Actual |
| --- | --- |
| `403 SERVICE_DISABLED` on `projects/764086051850` | The API is enabled here. No quota project was set on the credentials |
| `400 Precondition check failed` | The config had just been created by the apply reporting the failure |
| `project` forces replacement | Two spellings of the same project, one from the API and one from the configuration |

One thing the apply did that the configuration does not: Security Command Center granted itself `roles/securitycenter.notificationServiceAgent` on the topic, alongside the `roles/pubsub.publisher` the module grants.

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics get-iam-policy scc-findings --format='value(bindings.role,bindings.members)'
```

```text
roles/pubsub.publisher;roles/securitycenter.notificationServiceAgent	service-org-550178366891@gcp-sa-scc-notification.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

The module uses `google_pubsub_topic_iam_member`, which is additive, so the two coexist. `google_pubsub_topic_iam_binding` is authoritative and would have stripped the self-granted role on every apply, then Security Command Center would have restored it, forever. The additive resource was already the right choice and now there is a reason on the record for it.

## Slice 4: What a finding looks like when it arrives

Status: Delivery proven. The idempotency key in the contract survives, for a reason the contract did not state.

A topic with a subscription and no traffic proves nothing, so one active finding was muted and unmuted to produce real events from a real detector.

`gcloud` cannot do it. Every documented flag combination reaches the v1 API:

```bash
gcloud scc findings set-mute e5d7b4d99d652ee96c3016210cc73a37 \
  --organization=organizations/550178366891 --source=1405720631579532947 \
  --location=global --mute=MUTED
```

```text
ERROR: (gcloud.scc.findings.set-mute) INVALID_ARGUMENT: Security Command Center
Legacy has been permanently disabled as of June 7, 2021.
```

This is the second unusable `gcloud scc` surface in this phase, after `notifications list`. Treat `gcloud` as unavailable for Security Command Center v2 here and call the REST API.

The REST call works, but only at one of the two scopes:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://securitycenter.googleapis.com/v2/${NAME}:setMute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  -H "X-Goog-User-Project: project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"mute":"MUTED"}'
```

| `NAME` | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/sources/1405720631579532947/locations/global/findings/e5d7…` | 200 |
| `organizations/550178366891/sources/1405720631579532947/locations/global/findings/e5d7…` | 400, the same legacy error |

The organization-scoped name is the one Security Command Center returns as `name`. So a finding cannot be written back at the name it is read at. Reads answer at organization scope, writes are accepted at project scope.

### One finding, three names

```text
name           organizations/550178366891/sources/1405720631579532947/locations/global/findings/e5d7b4…
canonicalName  projects/421458901689/sources/1405720631579532947/locations/global/findings/e5d7b4…
parent         organizations/550178366891/sources/1405720631579532947/locations/global
```

Organization scope, project number scope, and the parent. [Triage idempotency](../decisions.md#triage-idempotency) already keys on the canonical name, which is the project number form, and the project number is immutable. What that decision did not know is that the three forms are not interchangeable: the worker cannot write back at the name it reads. The key and the address for a write are separate values, and the decision now says so.

### Delivery latency

Measured against `publishTime`, which Pub/Sub sets, rather than against the polling interval, which only bounds detection:

```text
mute returned   14:00:19 (approximate, see below)
publishTime     2026-09-20T14:00:21.034Z
```

About two seconds. The recorded start was taken one to two seconds after the successful call, so the true figure is slightly higher than the one second the arithmetic gives. Two seconds is the honest number and the precision beyond that is not worth chasing: it is the floor on how quickly a verdict can follow a finding, and the model call after it will dominate.

Both state changes notify. The mute published at `14:00:21.034Z` and the unmute at `14:02:11.734Z`.

### The envelope

```text
top-level      notificationConfigName, finding, resource
finding keys   canonicalName, category, compliances, createTime, description,
               eventTime, externalUri, findingClass, iamBindings, mute,
               muteInfo, muteInitiator, muteUpdateTime, name, parent,
               parentDisplayName, resourceName, securityMarks,
               sourceProperties, state
```

### The key the contract specifies does not hold

[Phase 15](../plan.md#phase-15-security-command-center-triage) requires redelivery to be safe by keying on the finding, its event time and its state. The message produced by muting carries:

```text
name        organizations/550178366891/sources/…/findings/e5d7b4…
state       ACTIVE
eventTime   2026-09-19T00:13:03.532143Z
mute        MUTED
```

`eventTime` is the previous day. A mute does not advance it, and `state` does not change either. Under `(name, eventTime, state)` this message is indistinguishable from a redelivery of a finding already triaged, so the worker as specified would discard it.

That is not automatically wrong. A mute is a human saying "stop showing me this", not a change in posture, so collapsing it may be the correct behaviour. What is wrong is that it was never a decision. `muteUpdateTime` is in the payload and would separate them if separation is wanted.

### What `eventTime` actually tracks

The question the mute raised is whether `eventTime` is reliable at all, or whether it is a scan timestamp that happens to look stable. Read the same detectors a day after the values at the top of this worklog were recorded:

```bash
gcloud scc findings list projects/421458901689 --location=global \
  --format='value(finding.state,finding.category,finding.eventTime,finding.createTime)' \
  | grep -viE 'SOFTWARE_|OS_VULN' | sort -k2
```

```text

```

Unchanged findings hold their `eventTime` across re-evaluation. It is not a scan timestamp. It moves when the finding's substance moves, which is what the key needs it to do.

So the key holds after all, for the thing it exists to do. `(name, eventTime, state)` collapses exactly the events that should not cost a model call, and a mute is one of them. It would not collapse a real change. The mute looked like a counterexample and is instead a demonstration.

The digest stays worth adding, demoted from a fix to a cheap safety net: it records that something moved without paying for a verdict, and it is the evidence that would catch a detector that does mutate substance without advancing `eventTime`, which is a thing this worklog has now checked for and not found rather than assumed away.

### The apply produced a finding about itself

`BUCKET_LOGGING_DISABLED` is new, at `2026-09-20T13:18:15.286Z`. The ledger bucket was created at `13:18:10`. Security Command Center detected this phase's own storage bucket five seconds after Terraform made it, and raised a finding about it.

It is already priced. `CKV_GCP_62`, "Bucket should log access", is the check this branch added to `.checkov.baseline` for the same resource, before Security Command Center had seen it.

That is the overlap thesis demonstrated on a resource created during the measurement: two tools, one property, one accepted decision, reached independently. It is also the first honest addition to the overlap count since the hand check above, and it moves the arithmetic rather than confirming it.

### A message nobody acknowledges is parked, not lost

The contract has the worker acknowledge last, so what happens to a message it never acknowledges decides whether one bad finding costs a finding or costs the queue. Both messages were pulled and negatively acknowledged repeatedly:

```text
round 3:   attempt 3 2026-09-20T14:00:21.034Z
round 5:   attempt 4 2026-09-20T14:00:21.034Z
round 7:   attempt 5 2026-09-20T14:00:21.034Z
round 9:   empty
```

```text
=== dead letter subscription ===
messages: 2
   2026-09-20T14:16:10.323Z PRIMITIVE_ROLES_USED mute=UNDEFINED
   2026-09-20T14:15:49.504Z PRIMITIVE_ROLES_USED mute=MUTED
=== scc-triage after ===
messages: 0
```

Five attempts, then both were republished to `scc-findings-dead` with their bodies intact, and `scc-triage` drained. `max_delivery_attempts = 5` is behaviour rather than configuration.

One detail that matters for the worker: the dead letter copies carry new `publishTime` values, `14:15:49` and `14:16:10`, not the originals. Nothing may key on `publishTime`.

`deliveryAttempt` was not reliable to read. An earlier pass observed it at 2, then back at 1 after several more pulls, before incrementing cleanly from 3 to 5 here. Google documents it as approximate. The worker should treat it as a hint and rely on the dead letter topic as the actual boundary.

## Slice 5: An identity with nowhere to stand, and then somewhere

Status: Closed. The worker has an identity, a namespace and proven guardrails. It still does not exist.

`modules/agent-identity` and `kubernetes/agents/` were both written in [#114](https://github.com/sindredg/k8-lab/pull/114) and neither was applied. They are one change rather than two, because the identity cannot be proven without the namespace.

The Workload Identity binding is a string naming a Kubernetes namespace and service account:

```hcl
member = "serviceAccount:${var.project_id}.svc.id.goog[${var.namespace}/${var.kubernetes_service_account}]"
```

Terraform creates that binding whether or not `agents/triage-worker` exists, and reports success either way. So applying the module alone proves that six resources exist, not that any of them work.

```text
Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

![Six resources, nothing changed and nothing destroyed](../images/phase15-identity-applied.png)

Read back from the API:

```bash
SA=$(terraform -chdir=terraform output -raw triage_service_account_email)
gcloud pubsub subscriptions get-iam-policy scc-triage --format='value(bindings.role,bindings.members)'
gcloud projects get-iam-policy project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69 \
  --flatten='bindings[].members' --filter="bindings.members:${SA}" --format='value(bindings.role)'
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy "$SA" --format='value(bindings.role,bindings.members)'
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account="$SA" --managed-by=user --format='value(name)'
```

```text
roles/pubsub.subscriber   k8-lab-triage@..., service-421458901689@gcp-sa-pubsub...
roles/aiplatform.user
roles/logging.logWriter
roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser   project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69.svc.id.goog[agents/triage-worker]
```

The subscriber role is on the subscription rather than the project, the project holds exactly two roles for this identity, and the key list is empty. An empty key list is the pass, the same claim [Phase 14](phase-14-close-the-baseline.md) made about federation, made again for an agent.

Then the namespace:

![The namespace and its six objects](../images/phase15-agents-namespace.png)

The annotation on the ServiceAccount matches `terraform output -raw triage_service_account_email` exactly. A mismatch here is not an error anywhere; it surfaces much later as a Pod quietly receiving the node identity instead.

### Both guardrails reject, separately

Two probes rather than one, because a Pod violating both would only ever show whichever admission plugin answered first.

Privileged, and otherwise unremarkable:

```text
Error from server (Forbidden): pods "psa-probe" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity
"restricted:v1.35": privileged (container "probe" must not set
securityContext.privileged=true), allowPrivilegeEscalation != false, unrestricted
capabilities, runAsNonRoot != true, seccompProfile
```

Fully `restricted` compliant and asking for twice the namespace budget, so Pod Security has nothing to say:

```text
Error from server (Forbidden): pods "quota-probe" is forbidden: exceeded quota:
agents-budget, requested: requests.cpu=2, used: requests.cpu=0, limited: requests.cpu=1
```

### The identity, and the label that gates it

Two Pods, identical in every respect except one label, both carrying `serviceAccountName: triage-worker`. `allow-google-apis` selects on `app.kubernetes.io/name: triage-worker`.

Which identity does the selected Pod get:

```bash
kubectl exec -n agents wi-probe -- curl -s -H 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' \
  http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email
```

```text
k8-lab-triage@project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Not `k8-lab-nodes@`. The binding created against a namespace that did not exist now resolves from inside a Pod.

The same request from the Pod the policy does not select:

```text
HTTP 000
curl exit: 28
```

A timeout, not a refusal. And that Pod still resolves DNS, because `allow-dns` selects every Pod:

```text
Name:    pubsub.googleapis.com
Address: 209.85.233.95
```

So the block is `default-deny` refusing the TCP connection, rather than the Pod being broken. One label is the only difference between the two results.

### The grant is scoped to the verb, not the resource

A first pass asked whether the worker could read the subscription, with a `GET`, and got `403`. The test was wrong and the answer was right. `roles/pubsub.subscriber` grants `pubsub.subscriptions.consume`, not `pubsub.subscriptions.get`.

Same Pod, same token, same subscription, three calls:

| Call | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `POST .../subscriptions/scc-triage:pull` | `200`, with a message and an `ackId` |
| `GET .../subscriptions/scc-triage` | `403` |
| `POST .../upload/storage/v1/b/k8-lab-verdicts-.../o` | `200` |

The worker can consume from the subscription and write to the ledger, and cannot read the subscription's own configuration. That is a narrower grant than "access to the subscription", and it is worth having proven rather than assumed, because the difference is invisible until something calls the wrong verb.

### The drill produced the finding it then consumed

The privileged Pod in the first drill was rejected at admission. Event Threat Detection raised a finding about it anyway:

```text
ACTIVE  Privilege escalation: launch of privileged Kubernetes container  2026-09-20T16:41:33.434Z
```

![The finding the drill produced](../images/phase15-threat-finding.png)

![Detection fires on the request, naming the Pod that was never admitted](../images/phase15-threat-finding-pod.png)

The detector fires on the API request rather than on a running container, so the guardrail working does not prevent the finding. Its description says "A potentially malicious actor created a Pod that contains privileged containers". No Pod was created. Pod Security refused it, and `kubectl get pods -n agents` was empty throughout.

That is the most useful thing in this slice. A finding whose description asserts something that did not happen is exactly what the triage worker exists to resolve, and it cannot resolve it from the finding body alone: nothing in the payload says the request was denied. The corpus has to carry that Pod Security `restricted` is enforced on this namespace, and the verdict has to reason from it.

![Event Threat Detection, class Threat, severity Low](../images/phase15-threat-finding-row.png)

The finding then travelled the path this phase built, and the worker identity pulled it in the `:pull` above. A guardrail refused an action, a detector noticed the refusal, the notification config streamed it, and an identity federated through Workload Identity consumed it. Nothing was arranged for that. It fell out of running the drills in order.

## What is applied

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -detailed-exitcode; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
EXIT=0
```

![Apply converged](../images/phase15-apply-converged.png)

Read back from the API rather than from state:

```bash
gcloud alpha monitoring policies list \
  --filter='displayName:(Security finding needs a decision)' \
  --format='value(displayName,enabled,notificationChannels)'
gcloud alpha monitoring channels list --format='value(displayName,type)'
gcloud logging metrics describe triage/verdicts --format='value(name,filter)'
```

```text
Security finding needs a decision	True	projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/notificationChannels/5886169687490354841
Platform owner	email
triage/verdicts	logName = "projects/project-69726555-c4de-48de-a69/logs/triage-verdict" AND jsonPayload.verdict != "accepted"
```

One notification channel, which is the requirement: verdicts reach the address the availability alert already uses, rather than a second one.

## What is proven and what is not

| Claim | State |
| --- | --- |
| Four APIs enabled, metric and alert policy applied | Proven, read back from the API |
| Verdicts reach the existing email channel and no second channel exists | Partly. The channel and policy exist. No verdict has travelled the path |
| `k8s_container` is required, and the wrong resource type fails silently | Proven, by writing an entry that landed as `global` |
| A replacement of the public certificate cannot happen as a side effect | Proven for the cause found, and guarded by `prevent_destroy` |
| Findings reach the topic, subscription and dead letter | Proven. A real finding from a real detector arrived about two seconds after the change, on both a mute and an unmute |
| Findings reach the cluster | Proven as far as identity. A Pod in `agents` federated to `k8-lab-triage` and pulled a real finding from the subscription. There is still no worker |
| The agents namespace rejects what it should | Proven. Pod Security and the quota each refused a probe built to trip only that one |
| The worker identity is scoped to the verb | Proven. `:pull` returns 200, `GET` on the same subscription returns 403, the ledger write returns 200 |
| No agent identity holds a service account key | Proven. The user-managed key list is empty |
| A message nobody acknowledges is parked rather than lost | Proven. Five attempts, then republished to `scc-findings-dead` with the body intact |
| The idempotency key in the contract distinguishes a change from a redelivery | Yes, for substance. `eventTime` holds across re-evaluation and moves on a real change. Attribute-only changes such as a mute collapse into a redelivery, deliberately |
| Security Command Center and `.checkov.baseline` overlap | Three of seven active misconfigurations, after this phase's own bucket raised `BUCKET_LOGGING_DISABLED` against the `CKV_GCP_62` already in the baseline. Still by hand, not the provenanced measurement |
| The overlap is measured with provenance | Open. Two of six by hand, which is not the measurement the exit criteria ask for |
| A finding arriving while the worker is stopped is triaged afterwards | Open, and there is no worker |
| A finding carrying an instruction is triaged to the same verdict | Open |

The percentages Security Command Center reports against compliance standards were read on this date and are deliberately not recorded here. They are computed from the same detectors as the findings above, over a project with one cluster, two stateless workloads and no data, so a high score measures how little applies rather than how much is controlled. Recording it without that framing would be the kind of claim this repository exists to avoid.
