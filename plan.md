# Secure GKE Workload Platform Plan

## Goal

Build and prove a secure GKE workload delivery platform. The platform is the portfolio project. An AI-assisted Kubernetes manifest reviewer will be a small reference workload after the first platform slice is complete.

## Current baseline

**Status:** Complete

- Modular Terraform foundation
- Custom VPC, private nodes, Cloud NAT, and DNS-only control plane endpoint
- GKE Dataplane V2 and Workload Identity Federation
- Autoscaling GKE Standard node pool
- `demo` namespace with an NGINX Deployment and ClusterIP Service
- Probes, resource controls, scaling, self-healing, restart, and rollback validation
- Credential-free pull request validation, required on `main`
- Deployment evidence in the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 worklogs

The existing cluster, namespace, manifests, and evidence remain in use.

## Milestone 1: Complete platform slice

The first milestone takes the existing NGINX workload through validation, policy, image delivery, external access, observability, resilience, and failure testing.

### Phase 3: Credential-free CI

**Status:** Complete

- Run `terraform fmt -check`.
- Run `terraform init -backend=false` and `terraform validate`.
- Validate Kubernetes schemas.
- Report Kubernetes security findings without blocking until Phase 4 and Phase 5 close them.
- Require both checks and a pull request before merge.
- Do not grant the workflow Google Cloud credentials.

Deferred: YAML and Markdown linting, until a change needs them.

**Exit criteria met:** Invalid Terraform or Kubernetes changes fail in a pull request, and `main` rejects the merge.

Documentation: [Terraform automation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/automate-terraform), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform), [kube-linter](https://docs.kubelinter.io/)

### Phase 4: Guard the existing workload

**Status:** Complete

- Add a `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` to the existing namespace.
- Enforce the Pod Security Baseline.
- Audit and warn against the Restricted standard.
- Add default-deny NetworkPolicies.
- Allow only required DNS and application traffic.
- Add a dedicated Kubernetes ServiceAccount.
- Keep unnecessary service account token mounts disabled.

**Exit criteria met:** Required traffic works. Privileged Pods and oversized resource requests are rejected at admission. An unlabelled client is denied by name and by address, and egress outside the declared paths is dropped.

### Phase 5: Custom image and Artifact Registry

**Status:** Complete

- Turn the existing NGINX workload into a small project frontend.
- Build a non-root container image.
- Create Artifact Registry with Terraform.
- Scan the image and deploy it by immutable digest.
- Validate image pulls from the private node pool.

**Exit criteria met:** The workload runs a project-owned, non-root image pulled from Artifact Registry by digest. The container port moved to 8080 through the Deployment and both NetworkPolicies, and Pod Security enforces `restricted`, closing the gap Phase 4 left open.

### Phase 6: Keyless application delivery

**Status:** Complete

- Configure Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions.
- Use a dedicated, least-privilege pipeline identity.
- Restrict trust to the intended repository and deployment context.
- Build, push, deploy, wait for rollout, and run a smoke test.
- Stop the workflow when rollout validation fails.

**Exit criteria met:** A push to `main` builds, publishes, and rolls out the image with no stored key. Trust is scoped to this repository by attribute condition, the pipeline identity holds a namespaced Role rather than a project role, and a rollout that does not become Ready stops the workflow before the smoke test runs.

### Phase 7: Gateway and HTTPS

**Status:** Complete

- Enable GKE Gateway API.
- Create an external Gateway and HTTPRoute.
- Reserve a static IP.
- Add DNS and managed TLS after the domain decision.
- Keep workload Services private.

**Exit criteria:** The workload is reachable through the Gateway while its Service remains internal. Met: `https://sindrg.com` returns `200` on a Google Trust Services certificate, port 80 redirects to it, and the Service is still `ClusterIP` with no external address, reached through a network endpoint group.

### Phase 8: Observability and evidence

**Status:** Complete

- Create one workload health dashboard.
- Create one actionable availability alert.
- Measure onboarding and deployment time.
- Capture an actual GCP cost snapshot.
- Write one short incident postmortem.

The deliberate failures are Phase 10.

**Exit criteria met:** Every platform claim below has recorded commands, results, and evidence.

| Claim | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Onboarding is repeatable | 59s from merge to Ready workload. [Phase 8](worklog/phase-08-observability.md) |
| Quotas work | Excessive request attempted and rejected. [Phase 4](worklog/phase-04-workload-guardrails.md) |
| Pod Security works | Privileged Pod attempted and rejected. [Phase 4](worklog/phase-04-workload-guardrails.md) |
| Network isolation works | Unauthorized connection attempted and denied. [Phase 4](worklog/phase-04-workload-guardrails.md) |
| Delivery is keyless | Successful pipeline run without stored cloud keys. [Phase 6](worklog/phase-06-keyless-delivery.md) |
| Rollout is controlled | Failed version detected and previous version restored. [Phase 10](worklog/phase-10-failure-drills.md) |
| Monitoring works | Deliberate failure triggered the expected alert. [Phase 10](worklog/phase-10-failure-drills.md) |
| Cost is understood | kr461.81 a week, three sources named. [Phase 8](worklog/phase-08-observability.md) |

Existing self-healing, scaling, restart, and rollback evidence counts toward this milestone.

### Phase 9: Surviving a node

**Status:** Complete

Two replicas survived a rollout and would not have survived a node going away.

- Raise the node pool floor to two, so a drained Pod has somewhere to land.
- Decouple `initial_node_count` from that floor, because it is `ForceNew` and moving it replaces the pool.
- Set a daily maintenance window, so node replacement is predictable rather than whenever the release channel arrives.
- Add a `PodDisruptionBudget` with `minAvailable: 1` to both workloads.
- Spread the Pods across both nodes, and record why a rolling restart does not do it.

**Exit criteria met:** Both workloads run a replica on each node, both budgets report one allowed disruption, and node replacement lands in a known window. `maxUnavailable: 0` already covered a rollout; the budgets cover an eviction, which is what `auto_upgrade` and `auto_repair` perform without asking.

Documentation: [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/), [Pod topology spread](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/), [GKE maintenance windows](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions)

### Phase 10: Failure drills

**Status:** Complete

The first work here that adds nothing and only tests what exists.

- Take the site down deliberately and time the alert.
- Ship a knowingly broken version through the real pipeline.
- Record the detection lag rather than the intended one.
- Restore both, through the documented path.

**Exit criteria met:** The alert opened about 3m15s after the site stopped serving and closed on recovery. A broken `/healthz` reached the pipeline, failed the rollout gate at 3m1s, and never reached a user, because `maxUnavailable: 0` refuses to retire a healthy Pod for one that is not Ready.

Two limits are now written down rather than assumed. Detection cannot beat roughly 3 minutes, because the check runs every 60s per location, the condition needs more than one location failing, and `duration` holds it a further 60s. And CI passed the broken change, because it validates Terraform and Kubernetes schemas and nothing parses nginx configuration, so a runtime fault of this class is caught after the image is built rather than before.

### Phase 11: Hardening and log analytics

**Status:** Complete

A security pass over what Milestone 1 built, before leaving the platform running unattended.

- Delete the unused `default` VPC, which was open to the internet on SSH and RDP.
- Turn on workload vulnerability scanning, which was off.
- Enable Log Analytics on logs already ingested and billed.
- Add one log-based metric, from a filter validated against real data rather than assumed.
- Redact the control plane endpoint from the public networking reference.
- Close the items Phase 9 left open: spread that survives a rollout, and a clean `terraform plan`.

**Exit criteria met:** `gke-vpc` is the only network and every rule on it is one GKE created. The cluster reports `VULNERABILITY_BASIC`. `_Default` reports analytics enabled. No node was replaced. `terraform plan` reports no changes for the first time in the project.

The audit found what it was looking for and then found something better. Planning the change surfaced a `ForceNew` drift on `initial_node_count` that would have destroyed both nodes on any apply, armed since Phase 9 raised the node floor by hand. Two limits are also recorded. `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` cannot be set by a project owner. Retuning the cost budget was rejected, because the account runs on credits and cannot turn usage into a charge, so the threshold guards nothing.

## Milestone 2: Load and autoscaling

Milestone 1 proved the platform under deliberate failure with close to no traffic. This milestone measures it under load, and proves the scaling path from a busy Pod to a new node.

### Phase 12: Load and autoscaling

Every run uses the same scripts and every step changes one variable, so each difference in the results has one cause.

- Add the `CADVISOR`, `HPA`, `DEPLOYMENT` and `POD` metric packages, and dashboard panels for sky's desired and available replicas and its throttled CPU.
- Add `loadtest/`: a stepped k6 ramp, a constant-rate rollout test, and a recorder that captures the HPA, Deployments, Pods, nodes and events every 5s.
- Generate load from a VM in `europe-west4` on a throwaway VPC reached through IAP, created and deleted with gcloud each session.
- Calibrate before the baseline, so the load generator is never the bottleneck.

| Step | Change | Runs | Prediction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | None | Ramp, rollout under load | sky saturates on its CPU limit first. A rollout drops requests, because nothing covers the time the load balancer takes to stop routing to a terminating Pod. |
| B | `preStop` sleep and a longer `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, sized from A | Rollout under load | No errors during a rollout. |
| C | HPA on sky, 2 to 8 replicas at 70% CPU, current quota | Ramp | Stops at 5 replicas, where `limits.cpu` reaches 3000m of 3000m. A deploy during the stall fails at the rollout gate. Both recover once load stops. |
| D | Requests, limits and quota sized from A, `maxReplicas` beyond two nodes' capacity | Ramp | A Pod goes `Pending` and a third node joins. The pool returns to two nodes after load stops. |

Each step is one pull request.

- A ramp stops at the first step where p95 exceeds 500ms or errors exceed 1%.
- `replicas` leaves sky's Deployment in C. Its last-applied record is edited first, or the pipeline's next apply drops sky to one Pod.
- The pipeline Role cannot create an HPA, so an operator applies it.
- The quota in D covers `maxReplicas`, one surge Pod, the smoke test Pod and nginx, and `pods` rises with it.
- The uptime alert stays armed.

Out of scope: sudden node loss and drain under load, autoscaling nginx, and custom metrics.

**Exit criteria:** A results table with one row per run: configuration, saturation rate, p95 at saturation, errors during rollout, peak replicas, nodes, and time from the HPA's decision to a Ready Pod on new capacity. The rollout error window, the quota stall and scale-down are each recorded with their recovery. The load generator and its VPC are deleted, and `gke-vpc` is the only network.

## Milestone 3: AI reference workload

Follows Milestone 2.

### Phase 13: Deterministic manifest review

- Add a small API for submitted Kubernetes YAML.
- Treat all submissions as untrusted input.
- Never execute submitted manifests.
- Run schema, security, and policy checks.
- Return reproducible findings with validator and policy versions.

**Exit criteria:** Known invalid manifests produce stable, testable findings without AI.

### Phase 14: AI explanation with closed validation

- Use Vertex AI only to explain findings and propose corrections.
- Authenticate from GKE with Workload Identity Federation.
- Revalidate every proposed manifest through the deterministic checks.
- Show a proposed manifest only when it passes revalidation.
- State clearly that submitted content is sent to a managed Google Cloud service.
- Limit request size, output tokens, rate, retries, and timeouts.

**Exit criteria:** AI suggestions cannot bypass the deterministic policy layer and no service account key is used.

## Later decision gates

These are not implementation commitments yet.

- Use Kustomize when environment or workload variants create real duplication.
- Compare Helm only when a reusable, parameterized workload package is needed.
- Compare Argo CD, Flux, and direct GitHub Actions when pull-based reconciliation or drift correction becomes necessary.
- Compare native policy controls, Kyverno, and Gatekeeper when policies exceed the native controls.
- Add Pub/Sub and workers only if synchronous review processing becomes a limitation.
- Add remote Terraform state before automated infrastructure apply or collaboration.
- Create a regional cluster temporarily for availability and recovery validation.
- Evaluate advanced supply-chain controls after the basic image pipeline is complete.
- Add Cloud Armor rate limiting if load testing shows a single client can drive the namespace to its quota.
- Test sudden node loss and drain under load once autoscaling is in place.

## Cost posture

- Use the available GCP credits to support hands-on validation.
- Keep the current zonal cluster available during active project work.
- Record costs and configure budget alerts. Measured at kr461.81 a week, fully covered by credits.
- Provision a regional cluster only when its availability behavior is being tested.
- Create the load generator VM and its VPC only for a test session, and delete both afterwards.
- Do not add GPU nodes unless self-hosted inference becomes a separate project goal.

## Immediate next step

Milestone 1 is closed. The platform is guarded, the image is project owned and deployed by digest, delivery is keyless, the workload is public through Gateway API, and every claim above has evidence.

Next is Phase 12, which puts the platform under load before it carries the manifest reviewer. Its first pull request adds the metric packages, the dashboard panels and the load test harness, so the baseline and every later run are measured the same way.
