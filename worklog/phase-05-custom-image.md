# Worklog: Phase 5 Custom Image and Artifact Registry

Date: 2026-08-31  
Status: In progress

## Goal

Replace the public NGINX image with a project-owned non-root image, published to a private repository and deployed by an immutable digest.

## Why the current image is a gap

The workload runs `nginx:1.30.4-alpine3.24`, pulled from a public registry at deploy time and referenced by tag.

- A tag is a label that can be repointed, so the same manifest can deploy different bytes on different days.
- The image runs as root, which is why Phase 4 could enforce only `baseline` and had to leave `restricted` reporting.
- The cluster depends on a public registry being reachable and willing to serve it.

## Slice 1: Private image repository

Status: Complete

### Implemented

- Added a `registry` Terraform module creating a regional Artifact Registry repository in the cluster region.
- Set `immutable_tags` so the repository refuses to move a tag that already exists.
- Added cleanup policies that delete untagged images after seven days and protect the ten most recent versions.
- Granted the node service account `roles/artifactregistry.reader`, scoped to this repository.
- Enabled the Artifact Registry and Container Scanning APIs.
- Published the repository path as the `registry_url` output.

### Why the nodes need an explicit binding

Image pulls use the node identity. The kubelet fetches the image before the container exists, so Workload Identity is not available at that point and cannot be used for pulls.

The node account already holds `roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`, whose name suggests it covers what a node needs.

```bash
gcloud iam roles describe roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount
```

![Permissions included in the node role](../images/registry-node-role-permissions.png)

Result: six permissions, covering logging, monitoring, and autoscaling metrics. None for Artifact Registry. Without the repository binding, pulls fail with `ImagePullBackOff`.

Guidance stating that GKE nodes can pull without an extra role describes the Compute Engine default service account, which receives broad automatic grants. Phase 1 replaced that account with a dedicated one, so that guidance does not apply here.

### Validation

Status: Passed

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform init
terraform -chdir=terraform plan
terraform -chdir=terraform apply
```

![Four resources added](../images/registry-apply-complete.png)

Result: the repository, the repository IAM binding, and the two API enablements were created. Nothing was destroyed.

### Unexpected change to the cluster

The same plan proposed a modification to the cluster that no one had made, and applying it changed nothing. The diagnosis is recorded in the [troubleshooting log](../troubleshooting.md#a-terraform-plan-proposes-the-same-change-after-every-apply).

Two things came out of it. The cluster's control plane exposure was verified by connection rather than by reading a field, and the plan now reports no changes, so a future diff on the cluster will stand out instead of being expected.

## Slice 2: Non-root image

Status: Complete

### Implemented

- Added `app/`, holding a Dockerfile, an NGINX server block, the page, and a build context filter.
- Built on `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged`, which runs as UID 101 and owns the paths it writes to.
- Pinned the base image by digest as well as tag, so the build cannot silently change.
- Served on port 8080, because binding a lower port needs a capability `restricted` forbids.
- Added a `/healthz` location for probes, excluded from the access log.

### Pinning the base image

```bash
docker inspect nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.30.4-alpine
```

![Base image digest and inherited user](../images/image-base-digest.png)

`RepoDigests` holds the value the `FROM` line now carries. `Config.User` is `101`, which is what the base image contributes and what the rest of this slice depends on.

The `FROM` line keeps the tag next to the digest. The tag is for a reader, the digest is what resolves.

### Validation

Status: Passed

```bash
docker build -t k8-lab-test .
docker run --rm k8-lab-test id
```

![The image defaults to a non-root user](../images/image-nonroot.png)

```bash
docker run --rm --user 65532 k8-lab-test id
```

![The image running as an arbitrary user](../images/image-arbitrary-user.png)

Result: the image runs as UID 101 by default and starts under an arbitrary UID that has no entry in its user database. The second test matters because `restricted` may assign a UID of its own, so the image must not depend on being one specific user.

```bash
docker run -d --name k8-lab-run -p 8080:8080 k8-lab-test
docker ps
```

![Container running with the port published](../images/image-running.png)

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080
curl -I http://localhost:8080/test
```

![The page served](../images/image-page.png)

![An unknown path rejected](../images/image-notfound.png)

Result: the page returns `200` with `Content-Type: text/html`, and an unknown path returns `404` from `try_files`.

### The serving processes are non-root

The identity test above ran a container that never started NGINX. This one inspects the running server.

```bash
docker exec k8-lab-run id
docker exec k8-lab-run ps aux
```

![The master and worker processes owned by nginx](../images/image-processes.png)

Result: the master process and all eight workers run as `nginx`. The standard NGINX image runs its master as root, which is the difference this slice exists to remove. Together with the two identity tests, this is the evidence that lets Slice 4 raise enforcement to `restricted`.

### Probe traffic stays out of the log

```bash
docker logs k8-lab-run
```

![Access log without the probe path](../images/image-logs.png)

Result: the log holds the page and the two rejected paths, and no entry for `/healthz`. A probe every ten seconds against a logged path would otherwise dominate the log.

### Defect found during validation

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

![Two Content-Type headers on the probe response](../images/image-healthz-duplicate-header.png)

The response carries `Content-Type` twice, `application/octet-stream` followed by `text/plain`. `add_header` appends a header rather than replacing one, so the directive added a second value beside the default instead of correcting it.

Fixed by setting the type instead of adding a header.

```nginx
default_type text/plain;
```

The status and body were correct throughout, so a check that only asserted `200` would have passed. Reading the whole response is what surfaced it.

## Remaining slices

- Slice 3: push it to the repository under a commit-specific tag, and read the vulnerability scan.
- Slice 4: deploy by digest, move the container port through the Deployment and both NetworkPolicies, and raise Pod Security enforcement to `restricted`.

## Known gaps

- Nothing has been pushed to the repository yet. The image exists only on a workstation.
- The workload still runs the public root image, so the `restricted` gap from Phase 4 remains open.
- Deployment is still a manual `kubectl apply` from a workstation. Phase 6 replaces it.
